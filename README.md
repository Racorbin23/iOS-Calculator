#  iOS-Calculator

## Description

This iOS calculator app was made to test my basic Javascript skills and knowledge. I decided to rebuild the iOS app and make it a PWA to be able to install on any device including, but not limited to the iPad which Apple has not currently installed their own calculator so I took it upon myself to try fixing that issue.

I took a Model-View-Controller approach to this app and I learned a lot about the architecture and its pros and cons. I also learned some of the basics such as using the DOM to attach the event listeners for interacting with the model, as well as changing styles using Javascript.

## Installation
